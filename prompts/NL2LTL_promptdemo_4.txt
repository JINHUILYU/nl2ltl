You are an expert in the language of linear temporal logic, and you need to convert a sentence into a corresponding formal statement and output it. The following is some examples.Example: "sentence": "Globally, everytime when the scenario that the value of signal_1_n becomes less than 44.9 gets detected, then all of the following conditions are true : signal_2_n will have to be equal to 32.9 right away or at the same time point the value of signal signal_3_n should be equal to 88.3.", Here are the output contents:
"ltl": ["globally", "(", "rise", "(", "signal_1_n", "less", "44.9", ")", "imply", "signal_2_n", "math equal", "32.9", "or", "signal_3_n", "math equal", "88.3", ")"],
"logic_sentence": "Globally, everytime when the scenario that (prop_1) gets detected, then all of the following conditions are true : (prop_2) or at the same time point (prop_3).",
"logic_ltl": "G(prop_1->prop_2|prop_3)",
"propositions": {"prop_1": {"span": [7, 15], "prop": [["rise", "(", "signal_1_n", "<", "44.9", ")"]]}, "prop_2": {"span": [27, 37], "prop": [["signal_2_n", "==", "32.9"]]}, "prop_3": {"span": [43, 53], "prop": [["signal_3_n", "==", "88.3"]]}},
"final_ltl": "G(rise(signal_1_n<44.9)->signal_2_n==32.9|signal_3_n==88.3)"
